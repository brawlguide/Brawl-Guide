            <p>Are you planning to buy anything from the shop soon? Of course you are. This is why you came to this book after all. If so, continue reading, because this article will help you change the way you look at the shop forever.</p>
            <p>Firstly, you are probably a F2P player. As with any other game developer, Supercell loves to confuse you with a multitude of shop offers with different discounts. This makes decision-making very difficult, since many items are priced similarly.</p>
            <p>Here are three tips to help you decide what you should buy and what you shouldn’t.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Never buy brawlers from the shop.</strong>Leave it to boxes instead, as you will get that brawler sooner or later.</li>
                <li><strong>Buy token doublers if they are on offer.</strong> Token doublers can drastically speed up your Brawl pass progress, which means you will be able to unlock rewards much faster.</li>
                <li><strong>Never buy pin packs.</strong> (Unless you really just need to burn some gems.) Pin packs are only useful once you have maxed out all your brawlers and have all the skins. Since this is unlikely, I suggest that you skip these pin packs.</li>
            </ol>
